This is a website developed by me to perform various functions and encryption techniques on the strings. Website is developed using fundamental PHP functions along with frontend languages like Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML. The AJAX is used to produce the instant results while typing the string to be encoded. A database is maintained to store the IP addresses of the visitors and counting the total no of visitors. A suggestion tab is also made using which the users can send the suggestions for improvement in the website. This project helps me in understanding the backend programming using PHP and AJAX along with frontend programming languages CSS, JS and HTML
