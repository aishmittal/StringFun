# StringFun
This is a website developed by me to perform various functions and encryption techniques on the strings. Website is developed using 
fundamental PHP functions along with frontend languages like Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML. The AJAX is used to produce the instant 
results while typing the string to be encoded. A SQL database is maintained to store the IP addresses of the visitors and counting the total 
no of visitors. A suggestion tab is also made using which the users can send the suggestions for improvement in the website. 
This project helps me in understanding the backend programming using PHP and AJAX along with frontend programming languages
CSS, JS and HTML
